# Obsidian-based open source literature review

This is an [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)-based literature review of the social dimensions of open source software. The idea is that Obsidian is simply a collection of markdowns. By using with Github, we can easily make it a shared space for literature reviewing. Obsidian is powerful because we can link ideas together, thereby connecting the dots. This is done through [backlinks](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Working+with+backlinks).

## Goals

 - To summarize open source software social studies in a that can be **visualized** using the tagging system and graph in obsidian.  We want a map of individual and team of researchers who work on the social aspect of open source software.
 -  To summarize open source software social studies that is **extensible** borrowing from the evergreen note system from [Andy Matushak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes).
 - After having summarized papers, we want to **identifying gaps** in the literature.

## Organization

- `papers:` Contains all the papers, with a short description and the main takeaways.
- `authors:` Contains all the authors, with links pointing to their papers and collaborators, and some metadata about them. 
- `fleetings notes:` are just that, fleeting notes that will be deleted if they are not consolidated after a while. A key point of writing extensible notes is that you want to keep track of your ideas that you then consolidate in permanent notes
- `permanent notes:` Ideas that are there forever. There are key take away from the literature review that we develop over time, pointing to concepts and papers when needed. Must be used parsimoniously.

## Instructions:

  1- Our author network is that of `mentoree-mentor` (e.g. phd student $\rightarrow$ supervisor). When linking authors, make sure you always only link mentorees to mentors.
